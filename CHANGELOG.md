Privacy Friendly Pain Diary can help you track and "share" your pain. It allows you to make daily diary
entries recording your condition and the intensity, location, nature and time of the pain you feel, as
well as the medication you take and additional notes. Records of your pain can help health
professionals gain an insight into the pain you are experiencing.

Privacy Friendly Pain Diary belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the SECUSO
research group at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. Privacy Friendly Apps are Android applications
which are optimized regarding privacy. Further information can be found here:
